# Windows 10 Cleanup Powershell Commands

This repo contains several scripts that can be used to remove the inbox default Windows 10 junk *\*Cough Features Cough*\* Universal apps.


Some of the scripts remove apps from all profiles in a currently running system.

One of the scripts will remove the apps from a mounted ISO file to prevent their installation from the start.

Another script will shutdown certain Windows 10 services that I find to be either useless, not necessary for my workflow, or to possibly be privacy issues.



## To Do
- Update Scripts (Haven't been updated since possibly 1809)
- Combine some of the scripts into one large script with options on which to run
- Create different app removal levels, such as
  - Basic
  - Strict
  - Custom
